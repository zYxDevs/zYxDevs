# Github workflow to compile latex and deploy the pdf to an orphan branch.
# Davide Gerosa (2021) https://github.com/dgerosa

# Edit the DIR and FILE variables with the location of the latex file.
# Place the yml file in a directory called .github/workflows

# The latest compiled pdf is made available at e.g.
# https://github.com/dgerosa/[repositoryname]/blob/build/[filename].pdf

# You can also add a badge to your README:
# [![compile_deploy_latex](https://github.com/dgerosa/[repositoryname]/actions/workflows/compile_deploy_latex.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dgerosa/[repositoryname]/actions)

# To compile multiple papers, duplicate the job called "paper" with different FILE/DIR names and add the "needs" line in the "deploy" job accordingly
